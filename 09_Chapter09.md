My dear reader, let us continue our journey through the mysterious world of loss functions in deep learning. In our last chapter, we delved into the enigmatic realm of hinge loss and its applications in training support vector machines. Now, we shall uncover the secrets of Cross-Entropy Loss, one of the most widely used loss functions in deep learning. Its prowess in tasks such as classification and image recognition make it an indispensable tool in the neural network architect's arsenal.

The Cross-Entropy Loss is based on the concept of entropy from information theory, which measures the uncertainty of a random variable. When applied to the output probabilities of a classification problem, it measures the difference between the predicted and actual probability distributions. By minimizing this difference, we can train our model to accurately classify input data.

But the mystery does not stop there! Did you know that Cross-Entropy Loss can also be used in other deep learning tasks beyond classification? A paper by Li et al. even explored its application in image segmentation!

So, let us strap on our detective hats and venture forth into the world of Cross-Entropy Loss. By the end of this chapter, the mist will lift and we shall have a complete understanding of this powerful loss function and its various applications in the field of deep learning.
My dear Watson, I have been summoned to investigate a perplexing case involving the mysterious loss of accuracy in a deep learning model designed for image classification. It appears that the model has been incorrectly classifying certain images even though they are quite clear to the human eye. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the culprit behind this conundrum was none other than the loss function being used - the simplistic Mean Squared Error.

As we dug deeper into the issue, we were led down the winding paths of information theory and entropy, and arrived at the doorstep of the Cross-Entropy Loss function. Our investigation had revealed that this loss function was tailor-made for multi-class classification problems, such as image recognition, and that its use could potentially transform the accuracy of the troubled model.

With the evidence in hand, we set to work implementing the Cross-Entropy Loss function in the model. To our amazement, the classification accuracy skyrocketed, and the culprit behind the misclassifications was finally caught! Through this experience, we not only solved the mystery at hand but also learned about the powerful tools provided by Cross-Entropy Loss in deep learning.

As we closed the case and pocketed our detective hats, we reflected upon the importance of choosing the correct loss function for a deep learning task. The journey to uncover the truth had led us down thrilling paths, but the reward of solving this mystery was invaluable.
My dear reader, let us explore the code snippet that was used to solve the perplexing case of the deep learning model incorrectly classifying certain images. As we discovered, the culprit behind this misclassification was the use of the Mean Squared Error loss function, and we resolved the issue by implementing Cross-Entropy Loss instead.

To understand this implementation, let us first consider the code that was used to define the initial model:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

model = Sequential([
        Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

In this model, we have a simple neural network with a single hidden layer consisting of 128 neural units. The output layer has 10 neurons, which corresponds to the 10 classes in our image classification problem. We are using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function here, which calculates the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual values. Our optimizer is the popular Adam optimizer, which is known for its robustness and efficiency. 

To implement Cross-Entropy Loss in this model, we simply change the `loss` parameter in the `compile` method to `'categorical_crossentropy'`, like so:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

model = Sequential([
        Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Here, we are using the `'categorical_crossentropy'` loss function, which is a typical choice for multi-class classification tasks. By using this loss function, the model learns to minimize the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the true class probabilities, thus allowing for more accurate classification.

And with that, we have solved the mystery of the misclassification of images and the importance of choosing the correct loss function in deep learning.
