After several hours of walking through the misty fields surrounding Holmes' cottage, we sat down and discussed the next case. It seemed as though we were coming up with the same problems repeatedly. For every model we built, every algorithm we coded, there was always one major issue that kept cropping up time and time again: outliers.

Holmes paced the length of the room, his eyes fixed upon nothing in particular. "Indeed Watson, outliers are the bane of our profession. They skew our results, muddy our waters, and leave us with headaches for days on end. We must find a way to combat them."

It was then that it struck me, like a bolt of lightning in the darkness. "Quantile Loss!" I exclaimed.

Holmes paused, turned and looked at me with a quizzical expression on his face. I quickly explained my thoughts. Quantile Loss, I told him, is the very thing we need to protect our models from those pesky outliers. It is a loss function that is designed to minimize the sum of absolute errors with respect to the median. Unlike other loss functions such as Mean Squared Error, Quantile Loss is not as sensitive to outliers.

Holmes nodded, "Indeed, Watson. Quantile Loss is a useful tool in our arsenal. It has been used in the realm of finance for portfolio optimization  and prediction intervals as shown by J. Tang et al. in "An Empirical Study of Deep Quantile Regression for Time Series Forecast" (2020). It is time we made use of it ourselves." And with that, we set to work once again, ready to take on the most difficult of problems with our newfound knowledge.
As we sat in front of the roaring fire, Holmes suddenly sat up straight in his chair with excitement. "Watson, I have just received a most intriguing case from a client in the banking industry. Apparently, they have been struggling to accurately predict the outcome of their investments due to the presence of outliers in their data."

I arched an eyebrow. "And what solution do you have in mind, Holmes?"

He grinned wryly. "Why, the answer is obvious Watson. We will implement the Quantile Loss function in their deep learning model. By minimizing the absolute errors with respect to the median, we will create a loss function that is less sensitive to outliers, allowing for more accurate predictions."

I nodded appreciatively. "But how will we go about implementing this new loss function?"

"Ah, my dear Watson, that is where we will need to roll up our sleeves and get to work. We must first modify our model to include the Quantile Loss function, which will require a change in the way we train our model. Let us investigate the available software libraries and see which ones have this functionality already implemented and which of these adapt easily to our code. Then we will need to fine-tune our hyperparameters and train our model until we have achieved the desired results." Holmes replied with an air of confidence.

And so we set to work, scouring through published journals, experimenting with new libraries and tweaking our code until finally, our model was complete. It performed with remarkable accuracy, even in the face of the most obstinate outliers.

As the sun set on our latest successful case, we sat back in our chairs, smoking jackets flowing around us, and raised a toast to the power of the Quantile Loss function. With its help, we were able to once again triumph over the most challenging problems our clients could throw our way.
In order to implement the Quantile Loss function in our deep learning model, we first need to modify our cost function. Instead of using Mean Squared Error as our cost function, we will use the Quantile Loss function that minimizes the sum of absolute errors with respect to the median of the data.

Here is some sample code that shows how to implement the Quantile Loss function using the TensorFlow library:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def quantile_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Custom loss function to calculate the quantile loss
    """
    alpha = 0.5 # set alpha to 0.5 to calculate the median

    # calculate the difference between the predicted and actual values
    e = y_pred - y_true

    # separate the negative and positive errors
    neg_e = tf.cast(tf.less(e, 0), tf.float32)
    pos_e = tf.cast(tf.greater(e, 0), tf.float32)

    # calculate the loss
    loss = (1 - alpha) * tf.reduce_sum(neg_e * e) + alpha * tf.reduce_sum(pos_e * e)

    return loss
```

This loss function takes in the predicted values (y_pred) and actual values (y_true) and calculates the difference between the two. We then separate the negative and positive errors to account for outliers in the data, and calculate the loss by summing both components based on the alpha value.

After defining the loss function, we can then use it to train our model:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=quantile_loss)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
```

In this example, we compile our model using the Adam optimizer and the Quantile Loss function we defined earlier as our loss function. We then fit our model to the training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.

By using the Quantile Loss function as our loss function, we create a more robust model that is less sensitive to outliers in our data. With this approach, we are able to help our clients in the banking industry make more accurate predictions and secure better outcomes for their investments.
